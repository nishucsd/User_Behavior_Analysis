# User_Behavior_Analysis
This is my project on finding trends in users activities based on their database access logs

I use a dynamic topic model to find common patterns in user behaviors, considering features like- Source ip, times of access, domains accessed , No. of sensitive events generated, etc.

Using the model, I also give the rate at which all the trends are growing anf how users are switching between different trends with time.
